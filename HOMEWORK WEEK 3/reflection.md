st main difference I notice between the two is that the AI-generated sketch approached the assignment in more of an algorithmic way, using loops to create the tiles and generate movement patterns. The movement in the AI-generated work is more uniform, making it more predictable, and does not incorporate user experience; the written code determines the movement of the piece rather than the user.

My work focuses on events such as when the mouse is pressed, the circle is moved to a random tile. I think this makes for more entertaining work because the user can interact with it more, and there is much more of a surprise element than seen in the AI piece, because you don't know where the circle will appear next.

Artistically, it was interesting to see how the AI took a prompt and interpreted it visually into a sketch. I feel as though AI almost plays it safe when creating something artistic; there is really no consideration of visuals beyond the dynamics and functioning of the work. It seems to aim for efficiency rather than artistic interpretation, as seen in the sketch. You can really determine that the piece is a quilt, yet it tries its best to visually represent this, which is a struggle for AI. It lacks a sense of general design principles and storytelling that is almost always found in human-created works. 

In my work the visuals are the main focus. I think I did a better job of executing my concept visually than AI. The colors, shapes, placement, and movement are more visually appealing than the AI's work, in my opinion.

In terms of the structure of the code, you can really see how efficiently AI can create code using loops and math functions to do the work. It has great organizational skills, and the code runs flawlessly. 

My approach is a bit different, drawing each individual shape. I think this has its advantages and disadvantages, the advantage being that it is easy to change the code visually, but the disadvantages being the code is longer, which can sometimes make it a little more difficult to manage.
