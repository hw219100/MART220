For my chatbot model, I chose the ChatGPT model 4o. I chose to do this model because it is the standard model that most people use, and it is free. More specifically, I wanted to look into what AI looks like to the daily user and what things average users can produce through AI. To find this model, I researched the most popular AI model used by Americans and chose the most popular one. The image is what I expected it to look like. I've found that AI almost has this hyperrealistic style to the images it produces. In its process, it breaks down images or human-fed data (real images) and then learns them in order to generate new images. In this process, it has created images that are identifiable by the prompt, yet using critical thinking, we can determine that the image is too perfect to be true. When it comes to objects or food in my example, AI does a pretty good job at generating the image. However, when it comes to more complicated prompts, such as the movement of human hands, which requires more learning, AI tends to struggle more in image generation. I thought the image overall benefited my project because it was an interesting addition to my real-life photos and made an interesting point that drawing a distinction between the two can sometimes be difficult.
